# The Americana Music Transformer

We have constructed two different transformer models for music. The first one 
is only trained on Americana music trained on midi files scraped off the Internet.
The second employs transfer learning from the pre-trained MAESTRO transformer.
Below are links to music generated with the two models. The music files with same 
number have the same primer, i.e. the first three bars of music is the same.

# A particularly interesting sample.

[This piece of generated music](/audio/transfer10.mp3)
we find particularly 
interesting. We find that the predicted part of the 
music from the transfer model contains polypony, 
even though we only provide the music with a monophonic 
primer.
