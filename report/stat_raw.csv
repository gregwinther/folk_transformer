They both also has a thing of really going all the way through a scale, playing every note, to get somewhere, which is a bit strange. These two things make it very clear it is not a trained human playing. I struggle to differentiate the two models as well.

But still, great work! It's pleasant and interesting, nothing grating or unmelodic :) "
